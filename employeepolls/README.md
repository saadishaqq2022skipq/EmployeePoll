# EmployeePoll
Udacity Nano Degree (React Project 2)

# Introduction
This is the application where every employee of company can access the application and create a poll with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. The process goes like this: An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.

#Technologies I used

I used `React JS`, `css`, `redux`, `jest`, `react testing library`

#Setup

- run `npx create-react-app "project-name"` to create the react application
- run `npm install` to install the packages
- run `npm install react-redux redux` to install react-redux & redux
- run `npm start` to start the application
